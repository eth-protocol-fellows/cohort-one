### Cohort Goal 

My goal for participating in the cohort-one program is to become a knowledgeable and regular contributor to the core Ethereum Protocol. 

## Project Ideas

### Go Ethereum 

#### Goal

To truly begin understading Ethereum's implimentation I should begin deconstructing one of it's main clients, geth. My goal is to help with development related to Geth and perhaps contribute to future features. 

#### Resources

- [Extended geth Notes](https://hackmd.io/eW_VaqZBTkeOTgkLyDmjdw)
- [go-ethereum repo](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
- [Dev guide](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/devguide)
- [good first issues](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [go-ethereum book](https://goethereumbook.org/en/)

#### Projects/Issues 

- [ ] [Issue #22311, "consensus/ethash: checksum in cache" file](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/22311)
- [ ] [Issue #23416, "Adding an RPC timeout parameter"](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/23416) -- ([review pr?](https://github.com/reds/go-ethereum/commit/4d5d95ca49e390172b53d9f9eb548123be0a0927) )

### Portal-Network

#### Resources 
- [portal-network-specs repo](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) 
- [High-level overview (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAX_bgcESoc)
- [Post on Functional Light Clients](https://snakecharmers.ethereum.org/the-winding-road-to-functional-light-clients/)

#### Goal

Piper has posted an issue regarding a geth portal-network implementation. This sounds like a problem I'd be excited to contribute to. 

### Py-EVM

#### Resources 

- [py-evm repo](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm)

#### Projects/Issues

- [Issue ##23416, "Make sure persist_block persists transactions](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/issues/1925)

#### Goal
TBD


### Fe Language

#### Resources

- [fe repo](https://github.com/ethereum/fe)

#### Goal

I have not worked on a programming language before and contributing would be a great way to learn Rust and contract language development.
