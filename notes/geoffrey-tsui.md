## Notes

What is MEV?
MEV (Maximal/miner extractable value) is an ongoing research area shining light on the profits generated by traders and miners (or validators in ETH2) by exploiting the microstructure in the way transactions are ordered in a block.

What is Flashbots?
Flashbots is an R&D team focused on reducing the MEV information/power asymmetry currently in place, and opening MEV techniques to be distributed to the general public, as opposed to concentrated in the hands of the few, in a way that's sustainable to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Flashbots has identifed the following six areas as goals to solve the MEV crisis:

1. Permissionlessness - No centralized party will be censor transactions
2. Efficiency - MEV techniques will not congest the network or otherwise waste resources
3. Pre-trade Privacy - Pending transaction data remains private until after its inclusion into a block
4. Failed Trade Privacy - Failed transactions will not be included into block (see Efficiency, #2)
5. Complete Privacy - No one, including miners/validators, aggregators, will be able to access incoming transaction data
6. Finality - MEV, once extracted, can not be reversed after inclusion into a block (ie protection vs time bandit attacks)
