# Cesar Brazon Notes

## Objectives

- [Describe the Ethereum architecture](./1_ethereum-architecture.md)
- [Understand what are the benefits of the improvements in Eth 2.0](./2_benefits-ethereum-2.md)
- Describe the EVM in depth
- [Formalize Account Migration research](./4_account-migration.md)
- Implement a proof of concept of the formalization of AA research

## Areas of Interest

- EVM
- Sharding
- Layer two solutions (Roll ups, zkSnarks, Plasma Channels)
- Accounts Experience (AX)
- Account Abstraction
- Meta transactions

## General notes

- RLP is the main encoding method used to serialize objects in Ethereum
- Everytime a new transaction is triggered, the first opcode that runs is `JUMPDEST`
- Some positions in the code are marked valid to `JUMPDEST`, but there are some restrictions - you need to know the valid destinations before caling the `JUMPDEST`, otherwise it will revert
- The payload of a normal transaction is `RLP([nonce, gas_price, gas_limit, to, value, data, v, r, s])`
- Mempool: Is where transactions go before they are included on chain


## Questions

Q: What's the difference between precompiles and opcode?

A: Precompiles are contracts which are embedded into clients with default addresses. Opcodes are instructions+ stored in the storage of the EVM, and it's what allow us to interact with the stack of the EVM.
We can say that precompiles are predefined bytecode, which allow us to create more complex logic (like `ecrecover`) and opcodes are native functions that allow us to interact directly with the EVM

Q: How does the versionin current works in the EVM?
A: It's a way to add upgrades to the EVM with backwards compatibility

Q: How can we interact with WASM through roll ups?

A:

Q: How does `JUMPDEST` opcode exactly works? Why is it needed?

A:

## Idea for PoC

Implement a fork in the EVM where the user can send a message with any signature and the transaction would be mined and the fees paid by the contract with the PAYGAS opcode
