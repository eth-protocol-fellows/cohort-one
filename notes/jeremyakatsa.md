# NFT Capacity Improvent Notes To Refer To:

## Possible Project Focus: Sharding (in order to improve NFT Capacity capabilities---> ETH2 Upgrade):

### Sharding Base:
https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/
- Sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereumâ€™s scalability and capacity. Shard chains spread the network's load across 64 new chains. They make it easier to run a node by keeping hardware requirements low. This upgrade is planned to follow the merge of Mainnet with the Beacon Chain.

### Interesting Findings, Observations and Discoveries:
- NFT marketplaces are essentially like "Digital-Museums" (OpenSea, Foundation, etc) and the wallets to store NFTs (Rainbow, etc) are like "Digital-Houses".
