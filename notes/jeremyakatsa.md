# Ethereum Capacity Improvents:

## Project Focus: Altair -- Minimal Light Client

### Phase 0 (current):
- Lodestar: https://lodestar.chainsafe.io/
- Beacon Api Direct Link: https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/
- Beacon Apis: https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs
- Bootstrapping Beacon Light Chain Client: https://notes.ethereum.org/@ralexstokes/S1RSe1JlF
- Altair: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md
- Validator Life Cycle: https://notes.ethereum.org/7CFxjwMgQSWOHIxLgJP2Bw#A-note-on-Ethereum-20-phase-0-validator-lifecycle
#### Basics:
---Beacon Chain: A registry of validator addresses, the state of each validator, attestations, and links to shards. Validators are activated by the Beacon Chain and can transition to states.
---Beacon Chain Checkpoints (similar structure as a Linked-List): A checkpoint is a block in the first slot of an epoch.  If there is no such block, then the checkpoint is the preceding most recent block.  There is always one checkpoint block per epoch. A block can be the checkpoint for multiple epochs.

---Epoch boundary blocks (EBB): can be considered synonymous with checkpoints.

---Sharding: A multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity. Shard chains spread the network's load across 64 new chains. They make it easier to run a node by keeping hardware requirements low. This upgrade is planned to follow the merge of Mainnet with the Beacon Chain.

---Attestation: a validator’s vote, weighted by the validator’s balance.  Attestations are broadcasted by validators in addition to blocks. Validators also police each other and are rewarded for reporting other validators that make conflicting votes, or propose multiple blocks.

---Staking Info: The 365-day example means that falling offline for a few days or weeks, is a much smaller penalty: dropping offline for 36 days would lose around 0.75%.

---Beacon Chain Validator Activation and Lifecycle: Each validator needs a balance of 32 ETH to get activated. A user staking 32 ETH into a deposit contract on Ethereum mainnet, will activate one validator. The Beacon Chain deactivates (“forced exit”) all validators whose balance reaches 16 ETH; stakers will be able to withdraw any remaining validator balance but not in eth2 Phase 0. Validators can also “voluntary exit” after serving for 2,048 epochs, around 9 days. In any voluntary or forced exit, there is a delay of four epochs before stakers can withdraw their stake.  Within the four epochs, a validator can still be caught and slashed. An honest validator’s balance is withdrawable in around 27 hours.  But a slashed validator incurs a delay of 8,192 epochs (approximately 36 days). To avoid large changes in the validator set in a short amount of time, there are mechanisms limiting how many validators can be activated or exited within an epoch.  For example, these make it more difficult to activate many validators quickly to attack the system. The Beacon Chain uses a deeper concept of effective balances which change less often than validator balances and enable technical optimizations.

---Light Clients (Current State): In its current state, light clients do not function well on Eth2 because there isn’t an effective way for them to stay synced to the network. Syncing requires downloading and verifying every block sequentially which requires an exorbitant amount of data and time. This automatically eliminates browsers or mobile devices from functioning as light clients. Altair, on the other hand, adds purpose-specific mechanisms — sync committees and a light client sync protocol — to make it super lightweight to stay synced to the chain. 

### Phase 1:
---Crosslinks: how the Beacon Chain follows the head of a shard chain. As there are 64 shards, each beacon block can contain up to 64 crosslinks.  A beacon block might only have one crosslink, if at that slot, there were no proposed blocks for 63 of the shards.

### Nodes & Clients:
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/
Full node:

---Stores full blockchain data.

---Participates in block validation, verifies all blocks and states.

---All states can be derived from a full node.

---Serves the network and provides data on request.

Light node:

---Stores the header chain and requests everything else.

---Can verify the validity of the data against the state roots in the block headers.

---Useful for low capacity devices, such as embedded devices or mobile phones, which can't afford to store gigabytes of blockchain data
