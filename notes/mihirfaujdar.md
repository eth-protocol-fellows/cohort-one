# **Areas of Interests**
* Sharding
* Pos Consensus
* Sharding
* EVM (Exploring the usage of opcodes)
* Data Structures (Tries, RLP Encoding/Decoding)

# Current Strategy
Some of the areas listed above will need to be revisited to ensure that foundational knowledge is sufficient for understanding ongoing technical work. This process will involve reading technical writings in whitepapers, GitHub specifications, and going over posts in forums ethresear.ch and [ethereum-magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/). It is expected that the completion of this process will take approximately 2~3 weeks. After this process, the following steps will be taken for progressing in stage one:
1) Read through the list of resources in stage one.
2) Collate a list of possible projects and write high-level notes for each.
3) Find an optimal project by taking feasibility and available time into consideration.
