## Light Client POC
I am building light client on the Prysm codebase. 
Work in progress: https://github.com/jinfwhuang/prysm/pull/5/files

### Goal
I want to build a light client that:
- Has a trustless setup
- Be able to answer API queries about the latest beacon state
- Have a working networking layer for the light client to acquire input data, i.e. light-client-updates, skip-sync-updates, and merkle proofs of beacon state. 
- The initial networking layer will be json rpc and grpc. 
- It is not yet decided if I will pursue in developing the spec that is similar to LES, using discv5 + libp2p.
- I will definitely pursue implementing the portal networks specific to the beacon chain light client.

### Implementation Plan
###### Step 1
Be able to run the server and get back some new data types; both grpc and http json. I am deviating slightly from what the [Lodestar team has done](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/tree/mpetrunic/lightclient-sync-protocol). I had discussions with those developers through writing the spec in the portal network. We are going to pursue using data types that could be better adopted in a peer to peer networking environment. See [discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/pull/102).

The key endpoints are:
```
GET /eth/light-client/v1/skip-sync-update?key=<content-key>
GET /eth/light-client/v1/updates
```

###### Step 2
- Implement client logic to use new data type to advance its head
- The light client serve some basic APIs, e.g.
```
GET /eth/v1/beacon/headers
```

###### Step 3
Use the proof mechanism to ask and interpret beacon-state-proof
```
Server: 
    - GET /eth/light-client/v1/beacon-state-proof?key=<content-key>
Light-Client: Be able to serve these APIs
    - GET /eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validators
    - GET /eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/finality_checkpoints
    - ...
```

###### Step 4
- Design and implement a peer discovery mechanism
  - Similar to LES
  - Use discv5 + libp2p
- This step might be skipped to favor the implementation of step 5 instead. This will be determined later.

###### Step 5
Implement [portal network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/tree/master/beacon-chain) as the networking layer.
