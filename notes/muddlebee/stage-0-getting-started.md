### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a global, open-source platform used for programmable money and decentralized applications that allow users have control over their own data.

Ethereum applications are diverse, spanning a range of industries and use-cases. They might be financial (like payments, lending, or insurance), games (like collectible cards, or virtual worlds), identity related (self-sovereign ID) or something entirely different. Each “web 3” application benefits from censorship resistance, decentralization, and security.

Ethereum is not controlled by anyone - it is built and maintained by thousands of people, companies, organizations and users all over the world.

- ####   Philosophy
Ethereum follows a philosophy of "Subtraction". This means resisting the natural tendency of organizations to grow and accumulate value within themselves, and cultivating value creation outside the Foundation in the broader Ethereum ecosystem:

-   Instead of capturing opportunities, we distribute opportunities for others
-   Instead of being defensive when others create value, we’re thrilled
-   Instead of trying to matter more, we try to matter less

- ####   Ecosystem  Support
The Ecosystem Support Program is a branch of the Ethereum Foundation focused on supporting projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community, in order to promote the success and growth of the ecosystem.

 - Mastering Ethereum, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood
https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook
> Mastering Ethereum is a book for developers, offering a guide to the operation and use of the Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, RootStock (RSK) and other compatible EVM-based open blockchains.

   - Blockchain Business Models by FourWeekMBA
   https://fourweekmba.gumroad.com/l/blockchain-busines-models/hp
  > A Blockchain Business Model is made of four main components: 
  >  - Value Model (Core Philosophy, Core Values and Value Propositions for the key stakeholders),
  >  -  Blockchain Model (Protocol Rules, Network Shape and Applications Layer/Ecosystem), 
  >  - Distribution Model (the key channels amplifying the protocol and its communities), and the
  >  -  Economic Model (the dynamics/incentives through which protocol players make money). Those elements coming together can serve as the basis to build and analyze a solid Blockchain Business Model.
