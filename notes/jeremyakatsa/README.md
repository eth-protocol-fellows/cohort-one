- [Monday 10/18/21]: Tested Lodestar Light Client Demo against Epoch, not working. Opening issue with Chainsafe. Updated Wireframe Guideline.
- [Sunday 10/17/21]: Built out skeleton for Demo as well as Icons and Wireframe.
- [Saturday 10/16/21]: Created separate Prototype Demo and Server projects.
- [Friday 10/15/21]: First batch of Classes and Interfaces laid out, moving onto building the logic and checking the batch against the Teku reference.
- [Thursday 10/14/21]: PrototypeBuildingBlocks notes completed (for now), Validator Package classes and interfaces now being built.
- [Wednesday 10/13/21]: Added Classes and Interfaces to Validator package Clients and BeaconNode within PrototypeBuildingBlocks notes.
- [Tuesday 10/12/21]: Added more Source Folders, Packages, etc to Prototype.
- [Monday 10/11/21]: Added Validator Package.
- [Sunday 10/10/21]: Prototype skeleton build recommenced.
- [Saturday 10/9/21]: Prototype skeleton build placed on hold, resolving new dependency importing issue before building can commence.
- [Thursday 10/7/21]: Refactoring prototype skeleton based off Gradle specifics (off Teku).
- [Wednesday 10/6/21]: Teku dependency import issue resolved (mostly) *issue closed*. Skeleton for prototype to be reorganized and built with Eclipse/Gradle diametrics (build reference added to README).
- [Tuesday 10/5/21]: Downloaded/Installed Gradle and Eclipse, moving onto testing Teku dependency imports.
- [Monday 10/4/21]: Downloading/installing Gradle and Eclipse to try and resolve issues. *Spring Tool Suite not condusive to building Beacon Chain Client in Java (due to Teku specifics).*
- [Sunday 10/3/21]: Added node interface to main prototype package, validation packages to source test (source folder) and other base classes. Opened issue ticket with Consensys in regards to Teku reference (https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/issues/4437).
- [Saturday 10/2/21]: Added specs and rebuilt skeleton based off Teku specifics and dependencies, converting specs into Java (from Python).
- [Friday 10/1/21]: Light client specs integrated into skeleton(as Python), Java conversion next.
- [Thursday 9/30/21]: Refactoring prototype skeleton based off Teku specifics.
- [Wednesday 9/29/21]: Prototype Skeleton Built. Validation issue closed (due to potential irrelevancy to testing out Altair Client prototype (might jump back on this later (dependent on relevancy))). Forked teku repo (https://github.com/jeyakatsa/teku).
- [Monday 9/27/21]: Opened repo to begin building out Minimal Light Client Prototype (https://github.com/jeyakatsa/Altair----Minimal-Light-Client-Prototype). Keystore validation issue *almost* resolved (https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3249). Still working on resolving Local Testnet connection issue locally on terminal.
- [Sunday 9/26/21]: Opened validation connection issue, currently working on resolving Local Testnet connection issue locally on terminal.
- [Saturday 9/25/21]: Ran multiple installations, validation error still occurring, moving onto opening issue with Chainsafe before moving onto resolving local testnet connection issue.
- [Thursday 9/23/21] Lodestar Beacon sync (with all networks) ran and tested. Sync error passed to Chainsafe core dev to resolve (https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3220). Currently working on resolving "Keystores not found within network file" issue for Validation (quite possibly through installation type)... running multiple installations to chip away at issue.~~
- [Wednesday 9/22/21] Lodestar Beacon synching error with Chainsafe currently being resolved (synch still processing)..~~
- [Tuesday 9/21/21] Had to restart synch in order to open synch issue with Chainsafe (taking much longer than anticipated (24+ hours) to synch), might need another 24hrs+ since synch restarted.
- [Monday 9/20/21] Connected to Testnet, synching Lodestar Beacon Node with terminal (awaiting sync to complete). Logging errors to open GitHub issue reports through Chainsafe when possible.
- [Sunday 9/19/21] Installed Yarn and Lodestar on Git terminal, moving onto connecting Mainnet.
