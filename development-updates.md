Project Dive-in:
- Altair -- Minimal Light Client: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/sync-protocol.md

Currently:
- [Tuesday 9/21/21] Had to restart synch in order to open synch issue with Chainsafe (taking much longer than anticipated (24+ hours) to synch), might need another 24hrs+ since synch restarted.
- [Monday 9/20/21] Connected to mainnet, synching Lodestar Beacon Node with terminal (awaiting sync to complete). Logging errors to open GitHub issue reports through Chainsafe when possible.
- ~~[Sunday 9/19/21] Installed Yarn and Lodestar on Git terminal, moving onto connecting Mainnet.~~
- ~~[Sunday 9/19/21] Installing Yarn for Lodestar in order to start building out a light client implementation (or prototype if feasable)~~
- [On-Going] Researching: Beacon Chain Specs(https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md) BeaconChain(https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/) & Sharding Proposal (https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/sharding_proposal).
